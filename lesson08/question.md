**Problem 8: Persistent Memory Array**  
**Task:**  
Implement a function that stores an array of floats persistently between calls (global static memory in C) and another function that retrieves it. Update and read this data over multiple frames from JS.  
**Learning Goals:**  
- Understand that global data in C persists across multiple JS calls.  
- Learn best practices for handling persistent simulation state.
