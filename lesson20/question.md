**Problem 20: Final Visualization and Analysis Page**  
**Task:**  
Put it all together: run the simulation in real-time, control it from the browser, store/load states with MEMFS, apply FFT-based analysis, and visualize results via canvas charts. Compare performance with and without optimization flags.  
**Learning Goals:**  
- Demonstrate mastery of all learned conceptsâ€”memory management, external libraries, I/O, optimization, and interactivity.  
- Show a complete end-to-end scientific workflow hosted in the browser.
