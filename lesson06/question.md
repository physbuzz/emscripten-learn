**Problem 6 (With cwrap/ccall): Re-Implement String Reversal**  
**Task:**  
Use `ccall` to invoke the string reversal function from Problem 3, noting how string arguments and return values are handled automatically.  
**Learning Goals:**  
- Learn how `ccall` manages string arguments and return values with less manual memory handling.  
- Understand the trade-offs between manual memory control and automated convenience.
