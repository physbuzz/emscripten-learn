**Problem 4 (With cwrap/ccall): Re-Implement Basic Addition**  
**Task:**  
Take the addition function from Problem 1 and now call it from JavaScript using `cwrap` to generate a convenient JS function wrapper.  
**Learning Goals:**  
- Understand how `cwrap` simplifies calling exported C functions.  
- Observe the difference between direct `Module._myFunction` calls and `Module.cwrap()` usage.
