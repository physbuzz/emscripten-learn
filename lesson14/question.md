**Problem 14: O(N²) Distance Calculation and Flags**  
**Task:**  
Implement an O(N²) pairwise distance calculation. Experiment with `-O3`, `-s WASM=1`, and other flags. Observe memory and runtime differences, and note any gains or issues.  
**Learning Goals:**  
- Learn to tune performance by trying different compiler and linker flags.  
- Gain insight into how memory usage patterns impact performance.
