**Problem 19: Compute Pair Correlation Functions and FFT**  
**Task:**  
After equilibrating your particle system, compute the pair correlation function. Use the previously integrated FFT library to process the correlation data, and return these results for visualization in JS.  
**Learning Goals:**  
- Combine simulation data with advanced numerical analysis.  
- Validate that external math routines work in tandem with the simulation.
