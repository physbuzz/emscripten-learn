**Problem 11: Alignment and Struct Layout**  
**Task:**  
Define a C struct that contains mixed data types. Write a function to populate it, and another to read it from JS. Ensure correct memory alignment and demonstrate what happens if alignment is off. Fix any issues with explicit alignment directives or careful data handling.  
**Learning Goals:**  
- Develop a clear understanding of memory alignment and data layout in Wasm.  
- Learn to diagnose and solve alignment-related issues when sharing complex data structures.
