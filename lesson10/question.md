**Problem 10: Using MEMFS to Store/Load Data**  
**Task:**  
Write a function in C that saves the current simulation state (e.g., positions) to a file on the in-memory filesystem (MEMFS), and another that loads it back. From JS, trigger saves/loads and confirm the state restoration.  
**Learning Goals:**  
- Gain experience with the Emscripten virtual filesystem.  
- Understand how to simulate file I/O within a WebAssembly environment.
