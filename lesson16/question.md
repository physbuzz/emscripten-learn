**Problem 16: FFT with an External Library**  
**Task:**  
Link in a small FFT library (like KissFFT) and implement a function to take a time-domain signal from JS, run FFT in C, and return frequency-domain data back to JS.  
**Learning Goals:**  
- Understand how to link against external libraries and manage their memory and interfaces.  
- Gain experience integrating more advanced computational routines into your web pipeline.
